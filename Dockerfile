# This Dockerfile is based on the docker_ubuntu_drmaa_conda Dockerfile written by
# John Kirkham <https://github.com/jakirkham/docker_ubuntu_drmaa_conda>.
#
# The following changes were made in this fork:
#   - Upgraded the base image to ubuntu:16.04 (debian:jessie-backports had problems with something in /proc/mount)
#   - Updated the hostname change in /etc/hosts in gridengine/install_ge.sh
#   - Updated the libdrmaa package name
#   - Removed the conda installation directives and commands

FROM ubuntu:16.04
